# Step 1: Prepare the dataset
# Load your dataset where each sample represents a software component or code segment
# The dataset should have features representing code properties and a label indicating vulnerability

# Replace X_train and y_train with your actual dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Feature Engineering (optional)
# Perform feature engineering if necessary, such as extracting relevant features from the code
# You can use techniques like tokenization, n-grams, or static code analysis tools

# Step 3: Train the machine learning model
# Use a suitable classifier for training the model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Step 5: Use the model for vulnerability detection
# Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to detect vulnerabilities in new code segments

def detect_vulnerabilities(code):
    # Preprocess the code if necessary
    # Extract relevant features from the code
    
    # Use the trained model to predict vulnerabilities
    features = extract_features(code)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    
    return prediction

# Example usage
code_segment = "some code segment"
vulnerability_prediction = detect_vulnerabilities(code_segment)
print(f"Vulnerability Prediction: {vulnerability_prediction}")
